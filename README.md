This example is intended to a quick demo and I offer no support and don't claim it's perfect. Use at your own risk.

Provides an example of taking a front facing camera image and reversing the image in constant real-time. This allows the image to be used for barcode scanning which won't work with a mirror image.

Front facing cameras in Android always mirror the image.

This works on a Nexus 5.

EXAMPLE:

Nomrally holding up some text 'ABC' to a front facing camera shows 'ABC' in reverse i.e 'CBA'. With this code 'ABC' is shown as 'ABC'.
